# FindMyPacks

FindMyPacks is a monolithic web application: Spring Boot serves both the REST API and the built React/Vite frontend, with PostgreSQL as its database. Docker Compose builds and runs the entire application and its tests; Java, Node.js, Maven, and npm do not need to be installed on the host.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop with Docker Compose v2

## Start the application

From the repository root:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The first startup builds the frontend and backend images, waits for PostgreSQL, runs the database migration, and creates the initial administrator.

Default local-development login:

- **User:** `findmypacksadmin`
- **Password:** `findmypacksadmin`

These are development-only credentials. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change `APP_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` before using any shared environment. The seeded password is stored as a BCrypt hash. The administrator is created only if that username does not already exist.

To confirm the API is ready:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/web/health
```

The endpoint responds with HTTP 200 and `{"status":"UP"}`.

The login API accepts JSON at `POST /api/web/login` and starts an `HttpOnly` session:

```powershell
$session = New-Object Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestSession
$csrf = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8080/api/web/csrf -WebSession $session
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8080/api/web/login -Method Post -WebSession $session `
  -Headers @{ "X-XSRF-TOKEN" = $csrf.token } -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body (@{ username = "findmypacksadmin"; password = "findmypacksadmin" } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

## Command-line interface (Issue #7)

The CLI uses the REST API and never connects directly to PostgreSQL. Keep the application running and execute every CLI command through Docker Compose:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d --wait
docker compose --profile cli run --rm cli help
docker compose --profile cli run --rm cli health
docker compose --profile cli run --rm cli token findmypacksadmin findmypacksadmin
```

The `token` command prints a Bearer token. Put it in `FINDMYPACKS_TOKEN` before using the protected status command:

```sh
export FINDMYPACKS_TOKEN="token-returned-by-the-command"
docker compose --profile cli run --rm cli status
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:FINDMYPACKS_TOKEN = "token-returned-by-the-command"
docker compose --profile cli run --rm cli status
```

`GET /api/cli/health` is public. `POST /api/cli/token` validates the initial username and password. Protected CLI endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and return HTTP 401 for a missing or invalid token. Change the development credentials through `APP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; do not commit real credentials or tokens.

## Logs and request correlation

Each Web and CLI operation writes a single-line JSON event to stdout with an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, level, layer, client, operation, status, request ID, and a short message. Database reads made by an operation produce a separate `db` event with the same request ID and client. Successful and failed login attempts are logged without passwords or request payloads. SQL statements and bind values are not logged.

```sh
docker compose logs -f app
```

API responses include an `X-Request-Id` header. Valid IDs supplied by callers are reused; invalid or missing IDs are replaced with a generated ID. To inspect the CLI API and database logs, run:

```sh
docker compose logs -f app
```

The protected `status` command produces one `api` event and one `db` event with `client` set to `cli` and the same `request_id`. Credentials and tokens are never included in these logs.

## Package registration and editing (issue #2)

After signing in, the home page shows a form to register and edit packages. Every field is required.

| Field | Form label | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `trackingCode` | Código de rastreio | 8 to 20 letters or digits; must be unique |
| `customer` | Cliente | 2 to 100 characters |
| `destination` | Destino | 2 to 100 characters |
| `carrier` | Transportadora | One of `CORREIOS`, `JADLOG`, `LOGGI`, `OTHER` |
| `status` | Status | One of `POSTED`, `IN_TRANSIT`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `DELIVERED` |
| `postedAt` | Data de postagem | ISO date (`yyyy-MM-dd`); cannot be in the future |

The form shows the Portuguese labels (for example "Em trânsito"), but sends the codes above to the API. Text fields are trimmed before validation. The same rules are enforced in the form, in the API (Bean Validation), and by constraints in the database.

**How to use it:**

1. Sign in and fill in the form.
2. Click **Cadastrar pacote**. On success the page shows "Pacote cadastrado." and the form switches to editing the saved record ("Editar pacote #N").
3. Change any field and click **Salvar alterações** to update it ("Pacote atualizado.").
4. Click **Novo cadastro** to clear the form and register another package.

Validation errors appear under each field. A tracking code that is already registered is rejected with a message on that field.

### Data model

The migration `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__create_packages.sql` creates the `packages` table:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `BIGSERIAL` | Primary key |
| `tracking_code` | `VARCHAR(20)` | Not null, unique |
| `customer` | `VARCHAR(100)` | Not null |
| `destination` | `VARCHAR(100)` | Not null |
| `carrier` | `VARCHAR(20)` | Not null; check constraint on the allowed values |
| `status` | `VARCHAR(20)` | Not null; check constraint on the allowed values |
| `posted_at` | `DATE` | Not null |

To inspect the stored data:

```sh
docker compose exec db psql -U findmypacks -d findmypacks -c "SELECT * FROM packages;"
```

### Endpoints

Both endpoints require an authenticated session and a CSRF token (`GET /api/web/csrf`, sent in the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header). Requests without a valid session receive HTTP 401. The JSON body uses the camelCase field names from the table above.

| Operation | Method and path | Success |
|---|---|---|
| Register a package | `POST /api/web/records` | `201` with the saved record |
| Edit a package | `PUT /api/web/records/{id}` | `200` with the updated record |

Error responses use the body `{"message": "...", "fieldErrors": {"field": "message"}}`:

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `400` | A field is invalid (`fieldErrors` lists each one) or the body is malformed |
| `401` | No valid session |
| `404` | `PUT` with an `id` that does not exist |
| `409` | The tracking code is already registered by another package |

Example with PowerShell, reusing the `$session` from the login example above:

```powershell
$csrf = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8080/api/web/csrf -WebSession $session
$body = @{
  trackingCode = "BR12345678"; customer = "Maria Silva"; destination = "Fortaleza"
  carrier = "CORREIOS"; status = "POSTED"; postedAt = "2026-11-10"
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8080/api/web/records -Method Post -WebSession $session `
  -Headers @{ "X-XSRF-TOKEN" = $csrf.token; "X-Request-Id" = "manual-test-1" } `
  -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```

A successful response looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "trackingCode": "BR12345678",
  "customer": "Maria Silva",
  "destination": "Fortaleza",
  "carrier": "CORREIOS",
  "status": "POSTED",
  "postedAt": "2026-11-10"
}
```

To edit, send the same body with `-Method Put` to `http://localhost:8080/api/web/records/1`.

## Dashboard (issue #6)

After signing in, the dashboard requests `GET /api/web/dashboard` and displays three charts based on persisted `packages` records:

- **Packages by status:** count of every package in the database, grouped by its current status.
- **Packages by carrier:** count of every package in the database, grouped by carrier.
- **Posts in the last 7 days:** number of packages by `postedAt` date, from today minus six days through today. Days with no packages are shown as zero.

The API computes these aggregates directly from PostgreSQL; the browser fetches them on sign-in/page load, and refreshes them after a package is created or edited. Use **Atualizar** to fetch the latest values without reloading the page. The endpoint requires an authenticated session and returns `byStatus`, `byCarrier`, and `postedPerDay` arrays.

### Logs for these operations

Registering a package logs an `api` event with the operation `create`, and editing logs `update`. The same request also produces `db` events with the same `request_id`: `check_tracking_code`, `find_package_by_id` (edit only), and `insert` or `update`. To follow one request, reuse the `X-Request-Id` header and filter the logs:

```sh
docker compose logs app | grep manual-test-1
```

On PowerShell, use `docker compose logs app | Select-String manual-test-1`. Passwords, tokens, and request payloads are not logged.

### Tests

The backend tests for this feature are `PackageDataAccessTest` (data access and `db` logs), `PackageApiIntegrationTest` (endpoints, validation, authentication, and correlated logs), and `AdminUserSeederTest` (keeps the 100% coverage independent of the database state). The form is covered by `PackageForm.test.tsx`. Run them with the command in the next section.

## Run tests

The test service runs frontend and backend tests in containers and uses the Compose PostgreSQL service:

```sh
docker compose --profile test run --build --rm tests
```

The backend produces a JaCoCo line-coverage report and enforces 100% coverage for application classes (excluding the Spring Boot entry point). The CI workflow runs this test command and builds the complete application image. To stop the application without removing database data:

```sh
docker compose down
```

To remove the local database and start fresh:

```sh
docker compose down -v
```

## Worktree collaboration

Three contributors can work asynchronously in separate worktrees and topic branches:

1. **Backend and database:** `backend/` (Spring Boot API, migrations, CLI, and API tests).
2. **Web interface:** `frontend/` (React/Vite page, login flow, and UI tests).
3. **Integration and delivery:** `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `.github/`, and documentation.

Create one worktree per contributor from the latest `main`, and keep each worktree on its own branch. For example:

```sh
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../FindMyPacks-backend -b feat/backend origin/main
```

Use corresponding distinct directory and branch names for the other contributors. Integrate changes through pull requests; never commit directly to `main`. Sign every commit in the PR with an SSH key registered on GitHub; the required `ssh-signatures` check verifies each commit before merge. GitHub rebase-and-merge rewrites commits and does not sign the resulting commits, so signature validation is enforced on PR commits rather than on `main`. The repository allows only Rebase and merge and requires a linear history, the `compose-tests` and `ssh-signatures` checks, and two approvals. The repository's pull request template is in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Deployment

No deployment workflow is configured yet because a deployment target has not been selected. The pull-request CI runs through Docker Compose and verifies both tests and the complete application image.
